# Polar Mapping Device 

<h2>Description</h2>
The trick to this device is that it can output a polar map of the resulting scan of the sonar. We took the input values as a matrix and sent them through Arduino to MATLAB. Each value of the angle and position was plotted on the polar plot. The figure below shows the polar plot without obstacles and with obstacles in range. We made a window on the polar map so that the maximum range is 150 mm (15cm).<br />
